# Endurance Intelligence - Brand Style Guidelines

> **"From the stick to the wheel, the book to the web... AI is the new medium."**

## 1. Core Philosophy: Classical x Digital
The Endurance brand aesthetic is built on the tension between **Classical Intellect** (History, Permanence, Deep Thought) and **Digital Speed** (Future, Glitch, Rewiring).

We do not hide the machine; we frame it within the legacy of human tools.

### The Narrative Arc
-   **The Evolution of Instruments**: We position AI not as magic, but as the next step in the lineage of tools (Stick -> Wheel -> Book -> Web -> AI).
-   **Rewiring**: The visual language suggests a "rewiring" of the old into the new—classical serif fonts that "glitch" into digital artifacts.

## 2. Visual Metaphor: Paper & Ink
The interface mimics a physical manifesto or a classical manuscript, digitised and active.

### Color Palette
-   **Warm Paper** (`#F4F4F0`): The foundation. Avoids sterile digital white.
-   **Ink Black** (`#1A1A1A`): Softer than pure black, mimicking dried ink.
-   **Sealing Wax Red** (`#8A1C1C`): Used for emphasis, alerts, and the "Red Channel" of glitches.
-   **Blueprint Blue** (`#0047AB`): Used for links, technical data, and the "Blue Channel" of glitches.
-   **Pencil Grey** (`#D1D1CD`): For borders, diagrams, and structural lines.

## 3. Typography
Our type stack reinforces the "Old vs. New" dialogue.

### The Voice (Headings & Body)
**Font**: `Cormorant Garamond`
-   **Usage**: Main titles, body text, menu links.
-   **Vibe**: Elegant, historical, authoritative.
-   **Treatment**: Often used in `Small Caps` for a "Table of Contents" feel.

### The Data (UI & Meta)
**Font**: `Inter`
-   **Usage**: UI elements, buttons, functional text.
-   **Vibe**: Clean, invisible, utilitarian.

### The Code (Index & Technical)
**Font**: `Courier Prime`
-   **Usage**: "Index" headers, version numbers, code blocks.
-   **Vibe**: Raw data, typewriter, terminal.

## 4. Symbology & Effects

### The Symbol: `⦿`
-   Represents the "Point of Focus" or the "Singularity".
-   **Usage**: Section breaks, list bullets, header separators.
-   **Styling**: Often rendered with a **Digital Glitch** (Red/Cyan offset) to show the "ghost in the machine."

### The Glitch
-   **Interaction**: Hover states (Menu, Links) trigger a split-channel RGB shift.
-   **Meaning**: The static permanence of the "Book" is being actively rewired by the "Digital" user.

## 5. UI Components

### The Sidebar (The Spine)
-   **Concept**: Resembles the spine of a book or a physical index card.
-   **Style**: Solid left border (`2px solid Ink Black`), Paper background, sharp shadow.
-   **Content**: Structured like a Manifest Index (e.g., `01 HOME`, `02 DESIGN`).

### The Timeline (Evolution)
-   **Concept**: A linear progression of tools.
-   **Style**: Vertical lines connecting icons (Stick, Wheel, Book, Web, AI), representing the continuity of innovation.

### Marginalia
-   **Concept**: Notes in the margins.
-   **Style**: Asymmetrical layouts where content is anchored by "sidenotes" or floating symbols.

## 6. The Bubble (Agentic Intelligence)

### Concept
The "Bubble" or "Sphere" represents a contained system of intelligence—an agentic world or a cognitive scaffold. It is not a static circle but a living, breathing entity.

### Visuals
-   **Structure**: Defined by fine `1px` strokes and dashed lines (`stroke-dasharray="4 4"`), suggesting blueprints or technical schematics rather than solid objects.
-   **Orbits**: Inner ellipses rotate slowly, representing processing cycles or layers of context.
-   **Matter**: Small particles float inside, mimicking biological organisms or data points in a neural net.

### Behavior
-   **Idle**: Organic, "breathing" movements. The system is alive.
-   **Interaction**: On hover, the system reacts with **Swarm Intelligence** (particles organize) and **Tension** (orbits distort).
-   **The Glitch**: Occasionally, the organic exterior glitches, revealing the digital "Red/Blue" channels underneath, reinforcing that this biological-looking system is actually a machine.
